Project Overview

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the World Happiness dataset using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
The goal is to understand how different socio-economic factors influence happiness across countries and regions.

 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used:

Python

Pandas – data cleaning, filtering, grouping, aggregation

Power BI and Matplotlib – data visualization
 
 Objectives

Analyze global happiness trends

Compare happiness across regions

Study the impact of GDP, health, freedom, and trust on happiness

Practice real-world data analytics using Pandas and Matplotlib

Draw meaningful insights beyond raw numbers

🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains 158 countries with the following key columns:

Country

Region

Happiness Rank

Happiness Score

Economy (GDP per Capita)

Family

Health (Life Expectancy)

Freedom

Trust (Government Corruption)

Generosity

Dystopia Residual


📊 Analysis Performed

Descriptive statistics using df.describe()

Region-wise happiness comparison

Filtering specific regions (e.g., Southern Asia)

Ranking countries based on happiness factors

Distribution analysis using histograms

Bar charts for regional comparisons

Relationship analysis between happiness and economic indicators

🔍 Key Insights

Developed regions like Europe, Australia, and New Zealand show higher GDP per capita, longer life expectancy, and greater trust in government.

Regions such as South Asia and Africa demonstrate that higher happiness does not always depend solely on GDP or life expectancy.

Happiness is influenced by multiple social and cultural factors, not just economic development.

📈 Visualizations

Bar plots for average happiness by region

Histograms to analyze happiness score distribution

Sorted comparisons of countries based on freedom and GDP

Properly labeled and rotated plots for clarity

🧠 Learning Outcomes

Strong understanding of Pandas data manipulation

Practical experience with Matplotlib plotting

Improved ability to interpret real-world datasets

Learned how to derive insights from data, not just numbers

🚀 Future Improvements

Add correlation heatmaps (Seaborn)

Perform regression analysis

Include interactive dashboards

Compare multiple years of happiness data
